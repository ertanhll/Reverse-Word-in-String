Write a C program that defines a function reverseWord which takes two parameters:

char *str: Pointer to a null-terminated string where the word reversal operation will be performed.
char *word: Pointer to a null-terminated string representing the word that needs to be reversed in the original string.
The reverseWord function should reverse the occurrence of the specified word within the input string. It should search for the word in the string and reverse it if found. The reversed word should replace the original word in the string, maintaining the positions of other characters.

The main function should demonstrate the functionality of the reverseWord function by providing an example usage. It should initialize a character array with a sample string and call the reverseWord function with the sample string and a specified word to reverse.

The output of the program should display the original string after the word reversal operation.

output:

```
This is the in-tup sentence
or
This is the input se-ecnetn 
...

```
